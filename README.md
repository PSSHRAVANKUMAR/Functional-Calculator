I'm excited to share my latest projectâ€”a fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of essential JavaScript concepts, including event handling and DOM manipulation, and to practice creating a sleek, user-friendly interface.

Key Features:
ðŸ”¸ Responsive Design: Optimized for usability across different screen sizes.
ðŸ”¸ Operator & Number Handling: Developed using intuitive event listeners for each button.
ðŸ”¸ Error Handling: Displays clear feedback for invalid inputs or calculations.
